# Snowflake Native App - Add

Learn Snowflake while you answer game questions.  You select SQL syntax as answers to gain points.  You build a script along the way that is presented at the end of the game for you to copy and paste into a SQL Worksheet to try it out.

Attending the local Snowflake User Groups where these games are played with a group of people have the potential to provide the opportunity to win Snowflake swag as prizes, including the opportunity to possibly with the cherished SnowBear.

Some of the more intermediate or advanced games provide challenges that are scored after discussion with an event coordinator and to provide real-world learning of similar situations.

Create your own game and contribute to the application through a local user group!
